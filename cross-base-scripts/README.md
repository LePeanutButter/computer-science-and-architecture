# Cross Base Scripts
## Laboratory 1a
Source file name: lab1a.c

Time limit: 1

Perform additions in base 10 with large numbers of digits.
### Input
Input should be taken from standard input. The input consists of a sequence of line pairs, where each line contains a string (up to 1000 characters) representing a positive integer in base 10. The first line contains a number indicating how many additions must be performed.
### Output
Output should be sent to standard output. The output consists of a sequence of lines, each containing the sum (in base 10) of the received strings.  
Leading zeros (0) must be removed from the result.

## Laboratory 1b
Source file name: lab1b.c 

Time limit: 1  

Perform multiplications in base 10 with large numbers of digits.
### Input
Input should be taken from standard input. The input consists of a sequence of line pairs, where each line contains a string (up to 500 characters) representing a positive integer in base 10. The first line contains a number indicating how many multiplications must be performed.
### Output
Output should be sent to standard output. The output consists of a sequence of lines, each containing the result of multiplying the received strings (in base 10, up to 1000 characters).  
Leading zeros (0) must be removed from the result.

## Laboratory 1c
Source file name: lab1c.c 

Time limit: 1  

Perform conversions between positional numeral systems (from a given base to base 10).
### Input
Input should be taken from standard input. The input consists of a sequence of lines, each containing a conversion in the following format: source base (between 2 and 36) and a string (up to 1000 characters) representing a positive integer in that base. The first line contains a number indicating how many conversions must be performed.
### Output
Output should be sent to standard output. The output consists of a sequence of lines, each containing the conversion of the input string from the source base to base 10.  
Leading zeros (0) must be removed from the result.
