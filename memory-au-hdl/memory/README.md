# Custom HDL Memory System

## Description
This project contains a set of digital logic components written in the Hardware Description Language (HDL). The primary focus is the `memory` chip, a composite memory unit that utilizes a 32-word, 36-bit-wide RAM module. The system supports synchronous memory output and controlled data loading via a write-enable (`w`) signal.

To support this design, multiple foundational components such as multiplexers and registers have been implemented.

## Chip List

### Core Memory Chip
- **memory.hdl**  
  A 3-channel memory unit that:
  - Accepts 3× 12-bit data inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`).
  - Stores them in synchronized RAM32 units.
  - Outputs them via registered output buses (`out0`, `out1`, `out2`).
  - Supports controlled loading via the `w` (write-enable) signal.

### Supporting Chips
- **RAM32.hdl**  
  A 32×12-bit RAM unit built using 12-bit registers, DMuxes, and multiplexers. Supports write control via a `load` signal.

- **Reg12.hdl**  
  A 12-bit register built from 12 single-bit `Bit` chips. Controlled via a single `load` signal.

- **Mux2.hdl**  
  A basic 1-bit 2-way multiplexer.

- **Mux4Way12.hdl**  
  A 4-way 12-bit multiplexer built from multiple `Mux2` units.

- **Mux8Way.hdl**  
  An 8-way 1-bit multiplexer using a hierarchical structure of `Mux2`.

- **Mux8Way12.hdl**  
  An 8-way 12-bit multiplexer that selects a 12-bit value among eight inputs using `Mux8Way` components for each bit.

## Test Files
The memory circuit is thoroughly tested using the following files:

- **memory.tst**  
  Test script that exercises the `memory` chip under various input and control conditions.

- **memory.cmp**  
  Expected output of the test script, used for comparison.

- **memory.out**  
  Actual output generated by running the test script.

These files are part of the test workflow using the [Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) or equivalent.

## How to Run Tests
1. Open the `Hardware Simulator` from the Nand2Tetris suite.
2. Load `memory.hdl`.
3. Open the `memory.tst` script.
4. Run the script.
5. Confirm that `memory.out` matches `memory.cmp`.
